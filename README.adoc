==== How Incidents are Generated

Icnidents can be generated from CloudForms in the following ways:

* Custom button
* Alert
* Policy
* Automate simulation
* Provisioning

=== Install rhconsulting Scripts

Follow these steps to install the miqimport/miqexport utilities:

While in `/root` directory, download the rhconsulting repository

 curl -sL  https://github.com/rhtconsulting/cfme-rhconsulting-scripts/tarball/master | tar xvz

Change to the newly created `/root/rhtconsulting-cfme-rhconsulting-scripts` directory, install the rake scripts and utilities:

 make install

The `/usr/bin/miqimport` and `/usr/bin/miqexport` utilities are now available to assist you when importing and exporting from CloudForms.

=== Download Repo

 cd /root
 curl -sL  https://github.com/ramrexx/ServiceNow_Incident/tarball/master | tar xvz

=== Import the Automate Domain

 /usr/bin/miqimport domain ServiceNow_Incident /root/ramrexx-ServiceNow_Incident/automate/

=== Import the Service Dialogs

 /usr/bin/miqimport service_dialogs /root/ramrexx-ServiceNow_Incident/service_dialogs/servicenow_incident_dialog.yml

=== Import the Custom Buttons

 /usr/bin/miqimport buttons /root/ramrexx-ServiceNow_Incident/buttons/ServiceNow_IM_Vm_.yaml

=== Update Automate StateMachine

* Log into your CloudForms/ManageIQ UI.
* Navigate to Automate / ServiceNow_Incident / Integration / StateMachines
** Update the *StateMachine* class schema with your ServiceNow instance information (i.e. dev?????.service-now.com) and credentials.
